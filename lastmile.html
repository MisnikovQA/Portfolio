        <h2>My Role in Testing LASTMILE</h2>
        <p>As a Software QA Engineer, I was responsible for conducting <strong>System Testing</strong> and <strong>Integration System Testing</strong> to ensure that LASTMILE's smart mailbox system functions flawlessly across all its components and user interactions.</p>

        <h3>System Testing</h3>
        <p>In my role, I conducted thorough system testing to ensure that the entire LASTMILE platform worked seamlessly, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>End-to-End Testing:</strong> I validated the complete user journey, from receiving notifications to opening mailboxes and managing settings via the mobile app.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> I ensured that cyber security features worked as expected, protecting users' sensitive information from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> I evaluated the app's user interface and experience, ensuring that it provided intuitive, easy-to-use controls for residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Integration System Testing</h3>
        <p>I also performed integration testing to validate the communication between the smart mailbox hardware and software components. This involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> Testing the API interactions between the mobile app and the mailbox system to ensure accurate data transfer for notifications, package details, and control commands.</li>
            <li><strong>System Compatibility:</strong> Verifying that the app successfully interacted with mailbox control systems, ensuring smooth functionality for opening compartments, managing user settings, and reporting issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Through comprehensive system and integration testing, I ensured the LASTMILE smart mailbox system delivered a reliable, user-friendly, and secure experience for residents, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the platform.</p>
