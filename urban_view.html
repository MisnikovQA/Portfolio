        <h2>My Role in Testing UrbanView</h2>
        <p>As a Software QA Engineer, I played a critical role in ensuring the quality and performance of the <strong>UrbanView</strong> platform, a sophisticated solution for managing digital signage networks. My involvement included extensive <strong>Integration Testing, Functional Testing, and Non-Functional Testing</strong>, all aimed at delivering a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly system.</p>
        
        <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
        <p>I conducted thorough integration testing to verify the seamless interaction between UrbanView and the <strong>PIS (Public Information System)</strong> units it manages. This involved testing the integration of APIs and data synchronization between UrbanView's centralized management system and the network of over 1,000 PIS units. The objective was to ensure smooth interoperability between components, such as real-time data updates, command execution, and system configuration management.</p>
        
        <h3>Functional Testing</h3>
        <p>My functional testing efforts focused on validating that UrbanView's features and functionalities met user requirements and expectations. This included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> I developed and executed comprehensive test cases to ensure the system's input-output functionality was as expected, without examining the internal code structure. This approach confirmed that all key features, such as content scheduling, remote control, and alert systems, functioned correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Table Testing:</strong> I used decision tables to validate complex business logic and scenarios within UrbanView, such as user role permissions and configuration settings, ensuring all possible combinations of inputs and outputs were thoroughly tested.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Non-Functional Testing</h3>
        <p>To ensure the robustness and usability of the UrbanView system, I also conducted various non-functional testing types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> I focused on evaluating the user interface and experience to ensure UrbanView was intuitive and easy to use for operators and administrators managing large digital screen networks. This included user feedback sessions, workflow testing, and UI improvements to enhance navigation and usability.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> I assessed the performance of UrbanView under different load conditions to ensure it could handle the expected traffic and data processing demands. This involved monitoring response times, throughput, and resource utilization.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> I pushed the system beyond its normal capacity to identify breaking points and ensure UrbanView could recover gracefully without data loss or downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation Testing:</strong> I reviewed and tested all system documentation, including user manuals, technical guides, and API documentation, to ensure they were accurate, complete, and user-friendly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My comprehensive testing efforts helped ensure that <strong>UrbanView</strong> is a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution, capable of enhancing digital signage management across various industries. By conducting thorough integration, functional, and non-functional testing, I contributed to delivering a high-quality product that meets modern digital communication needs and supports smart city infrastructure.</p>
