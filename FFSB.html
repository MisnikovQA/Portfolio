        <h3>Testing Approach</h3>
        <p>
            As part of my work on the FFSB Sensor Board project, developed using STM32, I conducted both 
            <strong>System Testing</strong> and <strong>Integration System Testing</strong> to ensure the robustness and reliability 
            of the board's functionalities. The FFSB board controls multiple components, including LEDs, fans, sound messages, button 
            messages, temperature and noise sensors, door buttons, and DC power for managing the PC's operational status (isLive). It 
            communicates with the PC via a COM port, exchanging status updates and commands every minute.
        </p>
        
        <h4>System Testing</h4>
        <p>
            I verified that the system, as a whole, met functional and non-functional requirements. This involved validating the 
            operation of individual components—such as ensuring accurate temperature readings, noise level detection, and proper fan 
            and LED control. Special focus was given to edge cases like simultaneous operations (e.g., triggering the door button 
            while sending fan control commands) to confirm stability under varying load conditions.
        </p>

        <h4>Integration System Testing</h4>
        <p>
            I tested the seamless integration of the board with the PC, ensuring real-time communication via the COM interface. This 
            included confirming the timely transmission of status updates and the proper execution of incoming commands. API and 
            communication protocols were rigorously tested to ensure no data loss or miscommunication occurred during command 
            exchange, even under high-frequency communication cycles.
        </p>

        <h4>Firmware Validation</h4>
        <p>
            The firmware, written in C, was designed for simplicity and ease of modification. I tested the flexibility of the code by 
            performing iterative changes and verifying that the firmware continued to function correctly after modifications. The 
            clear and understandable code structure allowed for efficient updates, reducing development turnaround time.
        </p>

        <p>
            By leveraging system-level and integration testing techniques, I ensured the FFSB board’s components worked harmoniously, 
            providing consistent performance and smooth real-time communication with the PC.
