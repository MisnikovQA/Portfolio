        <h2>My Role in Testing PIS</h2>
        <p>As a Software QA Engineer, I played a key role in testing the <strong>PIS (Public Information System)</strong>, a sophisticated software solution designed for managing and controlling smart signs in real-time. My involvement in this project encompassed extensive <strong>Integration Testing, Functional Testing, and Non-Functional Testing</strong>, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and overall quality of the system.</p>
        
        <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
        <p>I conducted thorough integration testing to verify the seamless interaction between different modules of the PIS system. This involved testing the integration of APIs for real-time communication with servers, ensuring accurate data retrieval, transmission, and application of various settings and configurations. The objective was to guarantee smooth interoperability between the different components, such as real-time transit information, environmental monitoring, camera access, and dynamic lighting control.</p>
        
        <h3>Functional Testing</h3>
        <p>My functional testing efforts were focused on validating that the PIS system's features and functionalities work as intended. This included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> I developed and executed comprehensive test cases that focused on the input-output functionality of the system without delving into the internal code structure. This approach ensured that the PIS system met all user requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Equivalence Partitioning:</strong> I applied this testing technique to divide input data into equivalent partitions and created test cases to cover each partition, ensuring efficient test coverage and minimizing redundant test cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Table Testing:</strong> To validate complex business logic, I used decision tables to test different combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs, ensuring that all possible scenarios were covered.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Non-Functional Testing</h3>
        <p>To ensure the PIS system's robustness and reliability, I also conducted various non-functional testing types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> I evaluated the performance of the PIS system under different loads to ensure it could handle the expected traffic and data processing in real time. This involved checking response times, throughput, and resource utilization.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> I tested the system's stability by pushing it beyond its normal operational capacity to identify its breaking point and to ensure it could recover gracefully without crashing.</li>
            <li><strong>Recoverability Testing:</strong> I assessed the systemâ€™s ability to recover from crashes, failures, and other interruptions to ensure that it could maintain continuous service without data loss or significant downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation Testing:</strong> I reviewed and tested all system documentation, including user manuals, technical guides, and API documentation, to ensure that they were accurate, complete, and easy to understand.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>My comprehensive testing efforts helped ensure that the <strong>PIS (Public Information System)</strong> was a robust, efficient, and reliable solution capable of enhancing the smart city ecosystem. By performing extensive integration, functional, and non-functional testing, I contributed to delivering a high-quality product that optimizes resource usage, provides valuable public information, and maintains high operational standards.</p>
