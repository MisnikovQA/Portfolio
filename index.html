        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Software QA Engineer with 4 years of experience in software testing. I started my career after completing a Software Testing course in 2019 at the College of Management Academic Studies, with ISTQB certification. My first experience in the field was as a freelancer on platforms like uTest and weTest. For the past two years, I have been working as a Software QA Engineer at Urban-Digital.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time, I have participated in a variety of projects and conducted tests on diverse systems, including websites, web applications, desktop software on Linux systems, and frameworks for sensor boards based on STM32. I was responsible for planning, analyzing, executing regression tests, and comprehensive testing of various products, ranging from full testing to small feature development.
